Stay Puft Forms is a typesafe, feature rich form component originally built for an e-commerce web app. The styling is dependant on Tailwindcss as well as some prebuilt components and Tailwind variables from  the `nwc-slimer` library. Due to ease of use regarding validation, the “package” is not a dedicated npm package. I decided to store it locally in our web app while ironing out all the bugs.

## Features:
  - Crafted with **simplicity** for a smooth developer experience.
  - **Accessibility** is front and center — because everyone should be able to use your forms!
  - Built on `react-hook-form` for easy input error handling right where you need it.
  - Powered by `zod` to keep input validation rock-solid.
  - Is developing and testing getting tedious? Use `fillValues` and a the `fillValuesCallback` props to auto-fill the form while developing.
  - Clean, consistent styling with error messages that make sense.
  - Google ReCAPTCHA integration for added security.
  - Includes a `honeypot` field to stop spam in its tracks.

## Ease of Use

The actual code here isn't the point but take a look at the <b>amount of code</b> our developers would have to write to implenent the same form with <b>fewer</b> features.

<div className="w-full flex justify-evenly" style={{ marginBottom: '5px' }}>
  <div>Before Puft Forms</div>
  <div>After Puft Forms</div>
</div>
<div className="w-full h-[250px] md:h-[500px] flex justify-around overflow-hidden mt-[5px]">
  <div className="w-full overflow-y-scroll">
    <img
      className="w-full"
      src="assets/before.png"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="w-full overflow-y-scroll">
    <img
      className="w-full"
      src="assets/after.png"
    />
  </div>
</div>

## Leverages:

- `react-hook-form`
- `zod`
- `tailwindcss`
- `react-google-recaptcha-enterprise`
